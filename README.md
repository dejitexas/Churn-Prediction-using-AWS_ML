## Churn Prediction

Customer churn, also referred to as customer attrition, poses a significant challenge for businesses. It arises when customers discontinue the use of a company's products or services, and high churn rates can have adverse effects on a company's revenue and profitability. To tackle this issue, machine learning algorithms can be leveraged to identify the factors that contribute to churn. Churn models are designed to identify early warning signs and recognize customers who are more likely to voluntarily leave. As part of this project, I will be delving into three different algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Through the application of these three powerful tools, I aim to develop a highly accurate classifier that can predict which customers are likely to churn and which are not.
